from fairest creatures we desire increase that thereby beauty's rose
might never die but as the riper should by time decease his tender
heir might bear his memory but thou contracted to thine own bright
eyes feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel making a
famine where abundance lies thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too
cruel thou that art now the world's fresh ornament and only herald to
the gaudy spring within thine own bud buriest thy content and tender
churl mak'st waste in niggarding pity the world or else this glutton
be to eat the world's due by the grave and thee when forty winters
shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field thy
youth's proud livery so gazed on now will be a tattered weed of small
worth held then being asked where all thy beauty lies where all the
treasure of thy lusty days to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
